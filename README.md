# Automatic Wsl Configuration and Stable Diffuion Webui Installation  

This project is for my use ONLY. It has no value to anyone else... But if it can help you, be my guest and feel free to use.

Some changes to the code might be needed for it to work for you... 
I've made it so it will work on my PC, with my current setup - "WSL debian distribution".

I do not plan on making this script adaptable for others... But who knows I might one day... 

**NOTE**: 
- For now the Password Input is not needed... So you can write anything the varible is not being used anywhere... I installed it for later use.oon to come.
- When you install the WSL Distribution, the first time it runs you must enter a UserName and Password. Once this is done, 2 input field appears on the main.ps1 window.
- You need to input the same UserName that you entered earlier... and as a said above, the password is not needed yet, so you can put in anything in this field.

## Requirements
- Here is a ref worth looking at --> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
- You need windows and Wsl working properly
- You also need admin rights on your PC
